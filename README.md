# Unlock Program

This is a simple Python console application that requires a specific code to unlock and open a web page in your default browser. It's a fun little program to demonstrate basic input handling and web browser interaction in Python.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter an unlock code. If the correct code is entered, it opens a predefined URL. A hint URL is provided to help the user find the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unlock_app.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unlock_app.git)
    ```
    (Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username once you've created the repository.)

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd unlock_app
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    python unlock_program.py
    ```

2.  Follow the prompts in your console. You'll need to enter the correct unlock code.

## The Unlock Code

The unlock code is embedded within the `unlock_program.py` file. The program provides a hint URL that might lead you to it!
